# Javascript
[Repository Listing](https://github.com/mjheick?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=javascript&sort=)

Written both for frontend and backend.

### Spaceship Earth
[Repo](https://github.com/mjheick/spaceship-earth)

I went to disney and saw Epcot. Loaded up blender, slapped a dome and exported the Obj. Slapped around with three.js and slapped up a couple video cards in the process trying to light it up. #davey504

### Uberorbs (javascript)
[Repo](https://github.com/mjheick/uberorbs)

Rewrote a fun little 12-stage kaboom game. Balls bounce around, you get one click to "pop" it. Meet a minimum criteria and you advance to the next level. Adding sounds and visual pizzazz made it so much better.

### video-converter
[Repo](https://github.com/mjheick/video-converter)

nodejs service that waits for video files to show up in a folder, then cracks up ffmpeg to convert and plops them into a separate folder. Wanted a lightweight service that executes when the file is ready and not on a hugely delayed cron.

# PHP

### ytuploader
[Repo](https://github.com/mjheick/ytuploader)

I had to write a script for [FirstSecondEveryMinute](https://www.youtube.com/@FirstSecondEveryMinute) to upload videos on a timely basis. The entire "journey" on uploading videos to Youtube was not as easy as people write it to be...

### heick.family
[Repo](https://github.com/mjheick/heick.family)

This is actually the family tree of my family. Used to be hosted at [heick.family](https://unliterate.net/heick.family/) but domain renewal costs were more than a Franchise license at McDonalds.

### mca2mcfunction
[Repo](https://github.com/mjheick/mca2mcfunction)

I have kids that play minecraft. One of them had an idea to "sell created assets" from the game to others. We figured out how to get things out of the game and how to put them into other worlds with mcfunctions.

# Visual Basic

### Uberorbs (vb6)
[Repo](https://github.com/mjheick/uberorbs)

Written in 2007 as a fun little 12-stage game. Balls bounce around, you get one click to "pop" it. Meet a minimum criteria and you advance to the next level. Adding sounds and visual pizzazz made it so much better.

# C

### minecraft2javascript
[repo](https://github.com/mjheick/minecraft2javascript)

### WoWScrnShotSorter
[repo](https://github.com/mjheick/WoWScrnShotSorter)

Simple command-line program so I can compile 500mb executable that enumerates a directory and renames filenames. Thrilling...

# Android
This can be anything intended for an Android written in Java or Kotlin

### orbit-soundtrack
[repo](https://github.com/mjheick/orbit-soundtrack)

I really like listening to music. Instead of buying Pandora or Spotify I instead used to addicively listen to the soundtrack of a game called [Orbit](https://playwithorbit.com/). I found the soundtrack and learned how to write an Android App to play the soundtrack.

# LUA
Yeah, Lua. I never knew I'd need to know this language until I needed to do something in it...

### wow-wq4achieve
[repo](https://github.com/mjheick/wow-wq4achieve)

There is a game called "World Of Warcraft", and in that game there are these goals you can complete called "Acheivements", and they're only acquirable under specific conditions, and I like to achieve them so I wrote stuff in Lua that runs on my computer in the game so I can know if I can complete things or not without wasting time searching the world for things...
